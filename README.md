## 🔍 Project Overview

As part of my internship at C-DAC, I worked on a cybersecurity project focused on analyzing **ELF (Executable and Linkable Format)** malware files. The objective was to extract key features from ELF binaries and support malware family classification.

## 🧠 My Contributions

- Parsed ELF headers and sections using tools like `pyelftools` and `lief`.
- Extracted opcode/bytecode and converted binaries into images for machine learning analysis.
- Generated `TELFHASH` to measure similarity between ELF samples.
- Integrated **VirusTotal API** to enrich malware samples with antivirus labels.
- Stored and indexed parsed data using **Elasticsearch** for efficient querying.
- Built automation pipelines for dataset creation and labeling.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python**
- **LIEF**, **pyelftools**
- **VirusTotal API**
- **Elasticsearch**, **Kibana**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **matplotlib**
- **Cybersecurity & Malware Analysis**
